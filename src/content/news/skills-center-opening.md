Dignity is often tied to the ability to provide for one's family. With this in mind, the Mkhonjana Foundation is proud to announce the opening of our new Skills Development Center.

### Bridging the Digital Divide

For many in our rural community, accessing basic digital services or business registration tools is a major hurdle. The new center features:
- High-speed internet access for business use
- Monthly workshops on financial literacy
- Mentorship programs connecting established business owners with beginners

### A Hub of Innovation

Local weavers and potters have already begun using the space to photograph their work for online marketplaces. By providing the tools and the space, we are not just giving a hand-out; we are providing a hand-up to the innovators of Mkhonjana.
