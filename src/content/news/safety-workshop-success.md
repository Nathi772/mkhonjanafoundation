Safety starts at home, but it thrives in community. Last week, the Mkhonjana Foundation hosted its first "Safe Community" workshop of the year at the community hall.

### A Collaborative Approach

We were joined by representatives from the SAPS and several local indunas. The discussion focused on:
- Neighborhood watch initiatives
- Reporting mechanisms that respect community privacy
- Engaging youth in constructive afternoon activities

### Building Trust

A major takeaway was the need for better communication between residents and local authorities. The Foundation acts as a bridge, ensuring that every voice is heard and that safety is a collective responsibility, not just an external service.
