The dust rose from the fields this past Saturday as the Mkhonjana Foundation officially launched its local Youth Sports League. With over 15 teams participating across football and netball, the energy was palpable.

### More Than Just a Game

While the scoreboard matters, our focus remains on the development of character. Speaking at the opening ceremony, local leader Mr. Gumede noted:
"Dignity is found in discipline. When our youth have a common goal on the field, they are less likely to lose their way off it."

### What's Next?

The league will run for the next three months, concluding with a championship festival in April. We are still looking for sponsors for kit and refreshments.
